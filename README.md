# Ray-Tracer
This is my ray tracering renderer that I made for my 3D Computer Graphics Course which can handle 3D meshes, geometric shapes, and modifiable light sources.


How to use:

Once the program opens, you'll be in a 3d scene shown through simple OpenFramworks wireframes. The objects in the default scene are hard-coded in for demonstration, but can still be moved around and deleted like normal.

Click and drag to move the camera around

Press c to toggle the mouse between camera control and object selection

Press s to add a new sphere to the scene

Press p to add a new plane to the scene

Press l to add a new light source to the scene

Press k to add a new spotlight to the scene

Drag and .obj file directly onto the window to add it to the scene

  click on any of the objects while in selection mode to to select them and change their properties

  you can also drag them around to move them

Press d to delete the selected object from the scene

Press r to render the scene; the result will be saved as "raytraced.png"

  the scene will be rendered from the perspective of the fixed camera, which can be previewed by pressing 1

  press 2 to see a side view, and press 3 to return to the free cam

After your scene is rendered, the result will be shown in the top left of the window. Press space to hide the thumbnail
